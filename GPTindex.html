            <h3>AeroVironment, Aeromechanical Engineer III (July 2021 – Present)</h3>
            <p>As an Aeromechanical Engineer III at AeroVironment, I have led the development and prototyping of cutting-edge aerospace systems, specializing in solutions for marine environments. One of my key projects was the design, prototyping, and testing of a new class of aircraft capable of operating in maritime environments, including shipboard launches and landings. I took charge of the end-to-end development, from initial design to flight testing, ensuring that all critical project milestones were met efficiently.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I spearheaded a team of engineers and technicians to address cold-weather hardening issues for aircraft, successfully lowering operating limitations and improving endurance by more than 5%. In addition, I handled multiple mishap investigations, applying root cause analysis techniques to prevent future incidents and optimize safety protocols. My work has contributed significantly to enhancing the safety and reliability of our aerospace systems.</p>

            <h3>AEROSONIC, Aeronautical/Mechanical Engineering Intern (June 2019 – Aug 2019)</h3>
            <p>During my internship at Aerosonic, I designed and fabricated test fixtures and critical sensors for various aerospace applications. Working with SolidWorks PDM, I gained hands-on experience in the fabrication process, ensuring high precision in the development of components. This role honed my ability to handle complex engineering challenges in a fast-paced environment while collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to meet project deadlines.</p>

            <img src="rensselaer.jpg" alt="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute">
            <h3>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY</h3>
            <p>I completed both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Aeronautical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, graduating <i>cum laude</i> in both programs. My academic career was marked by a strong focus on aerospace systems design, structural mechanics, and control systems, where I developed a solid foundation in advanced aeromechanical engineering principles.</p>
            <p>My Master's thesis, titled <strong>"Control of a Realistic Multibody CubeSat"</strong>, involved developing a multibody dynamics model and implementing advanced control systems using MATLAB and AutoLev. I focused on designing algorithms that optimized the CubeSat's stability and maneuverability, applying Kalman filtering and extended PID tuning techniques. This project further solidified my expertise in aerospace control systems.</p>
